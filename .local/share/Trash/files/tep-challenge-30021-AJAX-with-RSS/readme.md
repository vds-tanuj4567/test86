## Release 0 : Lady Gaga News generator

In this exercise we are going tolearn on how to use AJAX to consume and work with an RSS end point

- Create an empty webpage.
- Download the RSS feed at http://www.ladygaga.com/feeds/artist/content/ and store it in your project folder.
- Use AJAX (via the raw JS API or jQuery) to load the file into your page.
- Create a `<h1>` with the title of the RSS feed.
- Create a `<ul>`. For each `<item>`, create a `<li>` which contains the title and date of the post, and is linked to the post.


## Release 1 : Add time to the webpage

- Use `moment.js` to pretty-print the date posted ("3 hours ago").
